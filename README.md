## Tutorials, Projects, & Exercises

### 10 Minute No Risk Homework

After each class day students will be given a trinket exercise as a homework assignment that will take approximately 10 minutes to complete and are due by midnight on the same day they are assigned. These exercises are no risk and will be graded based on effort not on correctness. Completion of these exercises will help the intructor see what topics students are stuggling with so complete them on your own to the best of your ability and be sure to put what concepts you are confused about in the code comments!

### Tutorials

Students will complete the following guided tutorials, which are intended to help you get started on new topics.  They are graded on completion only.

- Super Hero Team Dueler

### Projects

Students will complete the following self-guided projects, which are meant to be more challenging than tutorials to test your understanding of concepts.

- Backwards Poetry
- Create a Quiz
- Herd Immunity Simulation

**The first two projects require a minimum of 5 commits, while the last project and superheros tutorial require a minimum of 10 commits. Commits must take place throughout the period of time from when they are assigned to when they are due.**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

### Project and Tutorial Submission

To submit each project for feedback and grading go to the [course page on trinket][] and be sure to follow each step below:
- Self-assess your project code against the evaluation criteria in the associated rubric linked in the project assignment
- Add your project github repo link to the trinket code as a comment


Refer to the project schedule below for the due date of each project.
Submissions will be accepted until midnight on the due date.
Late submissions will not be graded.

### Project and Tutorial Resubmission Policy

If you have submitted your project on time and have recieved at least a 2 on all rubric sections: after you recieve graded feedback from the TA or instructor you will have a total of 2 days after you recieve your grade to fix any issues and resubmit for final grading. 

### Quiz Policy

A total of 3 paper and pencil quizzes will be given in class.If the student experiences an unexpected event such as a medical issue or a family emergency the student may be approved to retake the quiz during testing center hours within a week of when the quiz was given.To be approved to retake a missed quiz the student must communicate with the instructor prior to the quiz date. 

## Evaluation Criteria

To pass this course, students must meet the following requirements:
- Complete all required coding tutorials:
  - Superhero Team Dueler
- Complete all required coding projects (this includes all commit requirements and homework related to each project):
  - Backwards Poetry
  - Create a Quiz
  - Herd Immunity
- Submit all tutorials and projects with rubric scores by the due dates listed above
- Pass all tutorial and project submissions according to the associated rubrics
- Pass all quizzes (there will be a total of 3 quizzes, lowest quiz will be dropped)
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences
- Complete 10 after class exercises 

### Evaluation Criteria Explained

- To pass each project or tutorial, students must earn the required number of points or higher indicated on the associated rubric. Note that all points within one project or tutorial submission are fungible (that is, interchangeable) and so if one portion of work is below the "Met All Expectations" column of the rubric, another portion of work submitted can "Exceed Expectations" (generally by completing stretch challenges) to earn an extra point to make up for the missing one. Therefore, it's wise to complete stretch challenges as "insurance" in case some work does not meet expectations. 
- The instructor or teaching assistants will review students' submissions and verify or correct their self-assessed scores, then share feedback with the student through a GitHub issue opened on their repository. Feedback will include their status on that submission (that is, whether their work is passing the rubric). Resubmissions after the 2 day period mentioned previously will not be considered unless the instructor has approved a resubmission in writing due to exceptional circumstances.
- Submissions received after the due date will not be considered unless the instructor has approved an extension in writing due to exceptional circumstances.
