# CS 1.1: Object Oriented Programming

## Course Description

This course reinforces the fundamentals of programming including variables, data types, control flow, conditionals, loops, lists, dictionaries, functions, and introduces object-oriented programming. Students will master top-level concepts in software development including writing pseudocode, using functions to process input into output, technical project planning, and diagramming. The course will also cover how computers work, from components and layout to memory and machine code instructions.

## Prerequisites

- CS 1.0 - Introduction to Programming

## Learning Objectives

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Implement and apply foundational object oriented techniques and best practices including encapsulation, composition, and inheritance 
1. Translate user stories and requirements into a program
1. Practice core programming concepts including data structures, control flow, repetition, and functions
1. Implement programming best practices, debugging, and testing in Python.
