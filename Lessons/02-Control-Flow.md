## Description

The basic building blocks of a program consist of storing data and processing that data.  In this session, we'll explore ways to store data in two data structures: lists and strings.  Then we'll look at processing with control flow (loops and conditionals).  Finally we'll expand on our program design skills by exploring how to move from high level design to agile implementation.


## Learning Objectives

1. Build confidence in working with others on code; sharing your code, giving feedback on another person's code, receiving feedback on your code.
1. Learn simple data structures and control flow.
1. Master using functions to separate code into modular elements.
1. Implement data structures and control flow in Python.

## Warm up (5 min)

- Review your tutorial and write 3 questions you have about it.

## Pop Quiz (10 min)
- Pop quiz - lists.  
- Post quiz - discuss how to learn about a data structure.

## Q/A & Discussion on Captain Rainbow Tutorial (30 min)
The tutorial covered a lot of key concepts:
- variables and data types
- data structures and CRUD
    - lists
- functions for modularity and code reuse
- methods
- control flow with conditionals
    - if else
    - comparison
    - boolean values
- control flow with repetition
    - for loops
    - while loops
- testing

## Activity: Design Madlibs (10 min)

- Pseudocode
- List of requirements

## Break (5 min)

## Discuss Design to Implementation (20 min)
- High level design tries to uncover all the requirements and think about how they come together in a program.  This produces a series of processing steps that are needed to go from input to output.
    - This is useful at the design stage because it helps to scope the project and identify requirements.
    - Translating all these processing steps directly into the details of a program really only works in small programs.
- In most programs, implementation works best using an agile approach which starts from a minimum viable product (MVP) and then iteratively builds features.  This allows features to change with changing requirements.

## Activity: Madlibs MVP (30 min)
- Design the Madlibs MVP
- Build and push the MVP to GitHub

## After Class

- Complete Madlibs by next class
- Read more about agile programming techniques
- Practice Python
