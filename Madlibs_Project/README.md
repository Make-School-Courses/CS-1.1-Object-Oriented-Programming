# MadLibs Project

## Description
Let's build something fun and silly! :-) Let's make a MadLibs game that generates sentences that sound realistic, but not always sensible.

## Requirements
* Display story with blanks for input words with correct type (nouns, verbs, ... etc.)
* Ask user to input words to fill in the blanks. 
* Output the story with the blanks filled in.
* A test suite to test user input.


## Code requirements
* Variable assignment
* Function definitions
* Core data types: strings, integers, floats
* Collection types: lists, tuples, dictionary


## Stretch
* Randomize the words of the same type (ie shuffle the 5 nouns)).
* Use a dictionary to generate the words.
* Use a differnet data structure to store words.
* Build with TDD
* Use the system module (for accessing command-line arguments)
* ...
